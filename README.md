# **Demo Sprint Project: About Me**

Triple Ten's Free Demo Sprint is what started it all for me. Learning the basics of HTMML and CSS to make this simple landing page was enough to pull me in to the world of coding. I plan on making adjustments to this once I learn Javascript. I will eventually set this up with the BEM methodology, including flat BEM. I will update this page with every update I make to it. In the meantime, I hope you enjoy this little snippet into my journey to becoming a software engineer!
