            As I used to say growing up, "I was born a rocker, lived my life a rocker, God be damned if I don't die a rocker!" I was raised on the likes of Pink Floyd, Metallica, Ozzy, Styx, KISS, and many others. As I grew older, I started to lean more into metal, then branched way out into epicore and the like. Still, nothing beats the classics!

            I love games. All kinds of games. I'm currently running two in-person D&D campaigns and currently playing the Gears of War games with my girlfriend.

            My original draft had these two things separate, but the truth is my friends ARE my family. My mom taught me a kind of love that you rarely find these days, so I share it freely with those I am close with. I like to hang out with them as much as I can, which isn't all that much (in my opinion).

            I have a dream. That dream is of me coming back to my current job (which is a lumber yard) and giving them a program that is 1000x better than the one they currently use. I believe the Triple Ten bootcamp (as well as the career path that this will put me on) will bring me closer to that dream.
